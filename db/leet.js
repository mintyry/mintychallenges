// Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

// You can return the answer in any order.

eg: [1,5,7,9,14]
target: 16

so we wanna find indices 2 and 3

var twoSum = function(nums, target) {

    let nums = [1,5,7,9,14];
    let target = 16;
// (starting point, end point, how to increment)
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
i+
    }
    
};

twoSum();

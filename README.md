This will come to be a conglomeration of challenges and practice put into one app. Will it make sense? Likely not. Will it work? It better.

## First challenge: ✅
Boss at the time of this writing (11/1/24) said it is not possible to have one big image at the top of a page and the three location columns (consisting of text/links) be aligned underneath it; aligned meaning: the left column aligned to the left edge of the image, the right column aligned to the right edge, and the center column centered.  
  
This, of course, also means none of the columns are to be text-aligned to their respective sides.  
They should all be left-aligned but still touching their respective sides.  
He even pointed out that I'm a coder, and I should know this. Bullocks, I say!  
As my mentor taught me: developers can achieve anything! (Just don't tell clients this.)  
### Bonus: make responsive on tablet and mobile
### Bonus: make it look nice

## Second challenge: ✅
Client once wanted a banner to change text every amount of seconds, which I was allowed to do for them myself.
I'd like to get simple js practice and make this again.

Lesson: Good refresher with setInterval. I tend to stray away from modulo operator because the logic of dividing AND THEN using the value of a remainder isn't natural to me, but it was useful here.

### Bonus: make an input field that allows users to edit the subsequent texts

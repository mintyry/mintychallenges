# mintychallenges
This will come to be a conglomeration of challenges and practice put into one app. Will it make sense? Likely not. Will it work? It better.

## First challenge:
Boss at the time of this writing (11/1/24) said it is not possible to have one big image at the top of a page and the three location columns (consisting of text/links) be aligned underneath it; aligned meaning: the left column aligned to the left edge of the image, the right column aligned to the right edge, and the center column centered.  
  
This, of course, also means none of the columns are to be text-aligned to their respective sides.  
hey should all be left-aligned but still touching their respective sides.  
He even pointed out that I'm a coder, and I should know this. Bullocks, I say!  
As my mentor taught me: developers can achieve anything! (Just don't tell clients this.)
